$$
 the notes  became  burdensome  when  reset provisions  allowed  their interest_6 rate  to be raised to  19.25 % last june  . 
$$
======================================  western union  had offered to swap  each $ 1,000 face amount  of  the notes  for  six shares  of  common stock  and  two new debt issues  :  a $ 500 note  paying  an interest_6 rate  starting at  16.75 %  annually and rising in  later years  , due in  1992  , and  a $ 500 note  , due in  1997  , paying  a fixed rate  of  17 %  and  including rights  protecting  a holder  against  a decline  in  the trading price  of  the bond  .

$$
====================================== of  course these turf battles  are unseemly ,  wasteful  and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in  the interest_4  of  national security  , but  mr. lehman  seems to be  part  of  the problem  rather than  part  of  the answer  .

 cincinnati-based p&g  took  an interest_1  ;  it  ordered  two studies  on  psyllium  and  cholesterol  .

$$
======================================  the manufacturers hanover corp. unit  ,  which  is seeking  repayment  of  a $ 36 million loan  , has asked  the court  to give  its claim priority  over  that  of  minpeco  ,  which  won  a $ 132 million judgment  against  mr. hunt  ,  his brother nelson bunker hunt  and  other defendants last year  in  a case  stemming from  their alleged attempts  to corner  the silver market  in ====================================== while claiming that  penalties  ,  legal fees  and  interest_6  have driven  the value  of  its claim  to  more  than  $ 250 million  ,  minpeco  has agreed to settle for  an allowed claim  of as much as  $ 65.7 million  . 
$$
======================================  automatic data  is redeeming  the bonds  because  the after-tax cost  of  the interest_6  on  the bonds  is higher than  the dividend yield  on  the common  ,  a spokesman  said . 
$$
 one thing  's for  sure  :  there  have been  a ton  of  them  , and  greater beings  than  the editors  of  the national enquirer  have shown  interest_1  . 
$$
but more recently ,  the pound  has been falling with  high inflation  ,  which  has also seemed almost impervious to  the high interest_6  rates  mr. lawson  deployed to stop  it  . 
$$
 mr. reynolds  also notes that since  british banks  have  no reserve requirements  ,  high interest_6 rates  are less likely to curb  inflation  than to cause  recession  . 
$$
 our advice  is  this  : immediately return  the government surpluses  to  the economy  through  incentive-maximizing tax  cuts , and find  some monetary policy target   that  balances  both supply  and  demand  for  money  (  which   neither   aggregates  nor  interest_6 rates  can do ) . 
$$
while  mr. roman  is  a workaholic detailsman  ,  mr. phillips  would rather delegate , leaving  him   time  for  his interests_3  outside  the office  . 
$$
======================================  the company 's earnings  before  interest_6  ,  taxes  and  depreciation  ,  which bondholders  use  a measurement  of  the chain 's ability  to pay  its existing debt  , increased  11 %  in  fiscal 1989  to  $ 926.1 million  from  $ 833.6 million  . 
$$
excluding  those businesses  ,  earnings  before  interest_6  ,  taxes  and  depreciation  for  1988  would have been  $ 728.5 million  . 
$$
======================================  financial analysts  note that  mr. rey  is attracted to  companies   that  are undervalued on  the basis  of  their real-estate interests_5  . 
$$
 that  means  unisys  must pay about  $ 100 million  in  interest_6   every quarter  , on  top  of  $ 27 million  in  dividends  on  preferred stock  . 
$$
 it  said  long-term interest_6 rates  , then above  9 %  , could drop to  7 %  by  the end  of  1989  , so  bonds  ,  which  benefit from falling  rates  , would be  a good buy  . 
$$
 a good half-hour  into  breakfast  at  the palmer house  ,  mr. o'brien  looks up from  his plate  after  mr. straszheim  says  something  about  people   who  believe  interest_6 rates  are about to nosedive . 
$$
''  he  says  the economy  , and especially  the employment numbers  , look much better than  he  expected ;  interest_6 rates  have generally declined ;  inflation has n't  run amok . 
$$
to keep  the exchange rate  pegged ,  mr. lawson  tightened  monetary policy  and pushed  interest_6 rates  up to  15 %  . 
$$
 this  doubled  the mortgage interest_6 rates  of  the many new homeowners  that  mrs. thatcher 's policies  had created , producing  widespread disaffection  and  pushing labor  ahead in  the polls  . 
$$
consequently ,  mr. lawson  saddled  mrs. thatcher  with  a record trade deficit  , renewed  inflation  and  high interest_6 rates  --  three political failures  in  a row  . 
$$
 the most important governments  have ignored  the role  of  low tax rates  in attracting  real capital investment  , instead emphasizing  financial flows  in  response  to  high interest_6 rates  . 
$$
then , when  the currency  falls ,  interest_6 rates  are raised to attract  financial flows  in  order  to stabilize  the exchange rate  .

$$
====================================== underscoring  the size  of  the deficits  of  the past few years  ,  the treasury report  showed that for  the first time interest_6  paid on  the public debt  --  $ 240.86 billion  -- exceeded  spending  on  social security  ,  the single largest government program  . 
$$

$$
although  he  expressed  confidence  that  the proposed new company 's cash flow  would be sufficient to cover  interest_6 payments  on  the debt  ,  he  estimated that  the company  would n't be profitable until  1994  or later .

in  response  to  bellsouth 's amended pact  ,  the kirkland  ,  wash.  ,  company  extended  its own offer  to buy  22 million lin shares  for  $ 125  apiece ,  which  would give  mccaw   a 50.3 % controlling interest_5  . 
$$
'' ====================================== under  its revised proposal  ,  atlanta-based bellsouth  would have  a 50 % interest_5  in  the new cellular company  and would be responsible for  half  of  its debt  . 
$$
 urging lin directors  to conduct ``  a fair auction  on  a level playing field  , ''  mccaw  asked how well  the public interest_4  would be served `` with  the bell  operating  companies  controlling over  94 %  of  all cellular  {  potential customers  } in  the nation 's top 10 markets  . 
$$
======================================  traders  said that selling  pressure was n't  enormous and that  the dax  dropped  friday more  on  a lack  of  any substantial buying interest_1  . 
$$
 she  could end up seeking  a fourth term  in  an economy  sick with  inflation  ,  high interest_6 rates  and  a heavy trade deficit  . 
$$
====================================== of  immediate concern  is whether  the thatcher government  will continue  mr. lawson 's policy  of tracking  the monetary policies  of  the west german bundesbank  and responding in  kind  when  the frankfurt authorities  move  interest_6 rates  . 
$$
======================================  a state trial judge  in  illinois  gave  preliminary approval  to  a proposed settlement  of  a suit  against  a bank  of  new york co. unit  ,  irving trust co.  , over  the interest_6 rates  on  irving 's former one wall street account money-market deposit accounts  . 
$$
 the plaintiffs  accused  irving  of paying  less interest_6  than promised in  a marketing brochure  . 
$$
and , by  the end  of  that week  ,  the key federal funds interest_6 rate  ,  which  is largely controlled by  the fed  , had settled at  8.75 %  , barely changed from  the level  of just under  9 %   that  prevailed  the previous week  .

$$
======================================  friday  ,  october 27  ,  1989  ======================================  the key u.s.  and  foreign annual interest_6 rates  below are  a guide  to  general levels  but do n't always represent  actual transactions  . 
$$
====================================== although  that  may sound like  an arcane maneuver  of  little interest_2  outside  washington  ,  it  would set off  a political earthquake  .

$$
 the government  had fallen  $ 300 million  behind in  interest_6 payments  . 
$$
 the remainder  of  the debt  will be exchanged for  new costa rican bonds  with  a 6 14 % interest_6 rate  . 
$$
 the industrial revolution  has produced  an explosion  in  the capital market  ,  which  is  a far cheaper source  of  funds  than  government-controlled banks  , where  interest_6 rates  for  prime borrowers  are around  16 %  . 
$$
======================================  one person  close to  the process  says  it  would not be in  the best interest_4  of  cbs news  to comment on  a  ``  work  in  progress  , '' such as  the hoffman re-creation  , but says  cbs news  is ``  aware  '' of  the concerns  of  ms. lawrenson  and  mr. hoffman 's former wife  . 
$$
======================================  leaseway transportation corp.  said  it  will  restructure $ 192.5 million  of  certain subordinated debentures  to reduce  its debt obligations  and  interest_6 expense  . 
$$
but  the proposed transaction  calls for  an exchange  of  the debt  for  new debentures  of  lower face value  and reduced  cash interest_6  . 
$$
also ,  debt holders  would be offered  an equity position  in  leaseway  ,  which  in  total  would represent  a controlling interest_5  in  the company  . 
$$
 he  noted that for  the first time  in  months   there  was  some light investor interest_1  in  the metals  . 
$$
====================================== in  addition  ,  the effective interest_6 rate  on  the $ 410 million  of  total remaining bank debt  after  the restructuring  is  10.66 %  . 
$$
 the combined effect  of  these changes  is expected to save  the company  about  $ 4 million  in  interest_6 expenses  next  year  , or  six cents   a share  . 
$$
because  municipal bonds yields  have risen at  a time  when  interest_6 rates  generally have fallen ,  some portfolio managers  are assuming that  bonds  bought now will appreciate in  value  as  the municipal bond market rebounds  . 
$$
======================================  ms. avedisian  believes that  the mutual funds  are selling  muni bonds   that  have  a negative convexity  --  those   that  have appreciated in  price  slowly relative to  the decline  in  interest_6 rates  . 
$$
 we  even invited  the public  to stop by and see  the program  , but there was n't  much interest_1  . 
$$
'' ======================================  advertisers  are showing  interest_1  . 
$$
 that  's because  municipal-bond interest_6  is exempt from  federal income tax  -- and from  state  and  local taxes  too , for  in-state investors  . 
$$
 the idea  is to have  money  rolling over  each year  at  prevailing interest_6 rates  . 
$$
 that  makes  them   a reasonable option  for  investors   who  will accept  some risk  of  price fluctuation  in  order  to make  a bet  that  interest_6 rates  will decline over  the next year  or so . 
$$
but  they  will have  disappointing returns  or  even losses  if  interest_6 rates  rise instead . 
$$
if  interest_6 rates  do n't change , bond  fund investors ' returns  will be about  equal  to  the funds ' current yields  . 
$$
 an interest_6 rate  is guaranteed for between  one  and  seven years  , after  which holders  get  30 days  to choose  another guarantee period  or to switch to  another insurer 's contract  without  the surrender charges   that  are common to  annuities  . 
$$
for  instance  ,  a cd-type annuity  from  north american co.  for  life  &  health insurance  ,  chicago  , offers  8.8 % interest_6  for  one year  or  a 9 % rate  for  two years  . 
$$
with  average maturities  of  a month  or so ,  money funds  offer fixed  share prices  and  floating returns  that  track market interest_6 rates  , with  a slight lag  . 
$$
to say that  the pentagon  should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke  congress  into acting irresponsibly leads to  the conclusion  that  the pentagon  should deliberately exaggerate  its needs  in  the national interest_4  ; in  other words  , that  it  is justified in committing  a crime  -- lying to  congress  -- because  it  is morally superior . 
$$
 strategy  is not  a separate event  in  an idealized sequence  of  discrete events  ;  it  is  a way  of  thinking   that  neutralizes  threats  to  our interests_4  in  a manner  consistent with  our financial  ,  cultural  and  physical limitations  . 
$$
====================================== while  wall street 's tough times  and  lower u.s. interest_6 rates  continue to undermine  the dollar  ,  weakness  in  the pound  and  the yen  is expected to offset  those factors  . 
$$
====================================== with  the stock market  wobbly and  dollar buyers  discouraged by  signs  of  u.s. economic weakness  and  the recent decline  in  u.s. interest_6 rates   that  has diminished  the attractiveness  of  dollar-denominated investments  ,  traders  say  the dollar  is still in  a precarious position  .

$$
======================================  pound concerns  aside ,  the lack  of  strong buying interest_1  in  the yen  is  another boon  for  the dollar  ,  many traders  say . 
$$
 the yen 's softness  ,  she  says , apparently stems from  japanese investors ' interest_1  in buying  dollars  against  the yen  to purchase  u.s. bond issues  and  persistent worries  about  this year 's upheaval  in  the japanese government  .

$$
======================================  colony banks  have  a major stake  in how  interest_6 rates  move because of  their enormous hong kong-dollar exposure  . 
$$
even though  the currency  is pegged to  the u.s. dollar  , with  a fixed exchange rate  of  hk$ 7.8  to  the american currency  ,  the u.s.  and  hong kong economies  do n't always move in  lock step  , making  it  difficult to predict where  interest_6 rates  in  the colony  will go .

======================================  unless mr. lawson 's resignation  leads to  a change  in  british *interest-rate policy  --  mrs. thatcher 's administration  firmly supports  high interest_6 rates  to keep  inflation  in  check  -- or posturing toward  full inclusion  in  the european monetary system 's exchange-rate mechanism  ,  mr. lawson 's withdrawal  will have  little long-term impact  on  exchange rates  ,  mr. chandross  concluded . 
$$
====================================== as  a result  of  the  refinancing ,  the company  said  the interest_6  on  the debt  will fall to slightly more than  11 %  from slightly more than  14 %  . 
$$
at  15 %  ,  base interest_6 rates  are  the highest  in  eight years  , and  the 7.6 % annual inflation rate  is by far  the highest  in  the european community  .

but  the interest_6 rates they  charge are often near  japan 's 54.75 % legal limit  , says  kenji utsunomiya  ,  a lawyer  specializing in  loan troubles  . 
$$
====================================== at  a news conference  ,  mr. fournier  accused  paribas  of planning to pay for  the takeover  by selling  parts  of  the company  ,  whose interests_5  include  insurance  , banking ,  tuna canning  ,  sugar  and  orange juice  . 
$$
 the debt reduction  is expected to save  the fort lauderdale  ,  fla. home video concern  about  $ 2 million   a year  in  interest_6 expense  . 
$$
 the zero-coupon  subordinated  notes  have  no periodic interest_6 payments  .

 eiji nakazato  ,  a takashimaya general manager  , admits that  his company 's image  is similar to  saks 's  and that  there  is  some interest_1  in  the idea  . 
$$
 that  is  another small encouragement  for  the federal reserve  to lower  interest_6 rates  in coming  weeks  ,  they  reasoned . 
$$
======================================  the loans  will be at  variable interest_6 rates  , currently  7.74 %   a year  . 
$$
 the company  also said  it  would n't make  the semiannual interest_6 payment  on  its $ 40 million  of  7 % convertible subordinated debentures  by  the nov. 1 due date  or within  the grace period  . 
$$
 the stock market  has had  a heightened concern  about  turmoil  with  high-risk financing  ever since  campeau corp.  nearly missed  an interest_6 payment  on  its junk bonds  in  september  .

$$
======================================  thursday  ,  october 26  ,  1989  ======================================  the key u.s.  and  foreign annual interest_6 rates  below are  a guide  to  general levels  but do n't always represent  actual transactions  . 
$$
 the year-earlier quarter  included  a one-time after-tax gain  of  $ 223.4 million  from  the sale  of  interests_5  in  its computerized reservations partnership  ,  covia  . 
$$
====================================== for  the nine months  ,  net income  fell  71 %  to  $ 317.3 million  , or  $ 14.66   a share  , from  $ 1.1 billion  , or  $ 34.35   a share  ,  which  includes  the gain  from  the sale  of  covia interests_5  . 
$$
 that property  was donated to  goodwill  by  artra group inc.  ,  a northbrook  ,  ill.  ,  company  with  interests_5  in  fashion jewelry  and  accessories  . 
$$
but  the document  -- featuring  a passel  of  new details  -- is sure to revive  interest_1  in  the matter  on  capitol hill  , where  lawmakers   this week  are deciding on  appropriations  for  northrop 's most important pentagon program  ,  the b-2 stealth bomber  . 
$$
======================================  the company  is asking  the international chamber  of  commerce  to order  asia culture travel  and  its associates  to return  the $ 6,250,000  , plus  interest_6  `` at  the highest lawful rate  . 
$$
 karl von der heyden  ,  chief financial officer  , said  he  is talking with  bankers  about refinancing between  $ 2.5 billion  and  $ 3 billion  of  rjr loans  at  lower interest_6 rates  , possibly securing  the refinanced debt  with  some  of  rjr 's assets  . 
$$
``  there  would have to be  some cataclysmic event  for  us  not to bring  our interest_6 rate  down . 
$$
and although  the company  apparently is meeting  its cash-interest payments  with  ease  ,  the clock  is ticking on  its non-cash notes  -- to  the tune  of about  $ 1.4 billion  of  accrued interest_6   this year  , with  the amounts  expected to rise to about  $ 2.3 billion  in  1993  . 
$$
 some time  before  april 1991  ,  rjr  must fix  the interest_6  rates on  $ 5.8 billion worth  of  pik bonds  so  the notes trade  at  par  , in  accordance  with  the bonds ' terms  . 
$$
 that  means if  the notes  continue trading below  their $ 100 par value  --  they  are now trading below  $ 80  ( excluding  accrued interest_6  ) --  rjr  must boost  the bonds ' *interest  rates as high as necessary to drive  their market price  to  $ 100  . 
$$
 that  means if  the notes  continue trading below  their $ 100 par value  --  they  are now trading below  $ 80  ( excluding  accrued *interest  ) --  rjr  must boost  the bonds ' interest_6  rates as high as necessary to drive  their market price  to  $ 100  . 
$$
 that  could require fixing  the interest_6 rate  as high as  20 %  ,  bankers  say , especially if  the junk-bond market  remains  weak  or deteriorates further . 
$$
 the bonds  will continue to accrue  interest_6  in  paper  until  the mid-1990s  to late  1990s  . 
$$
and that , of  course  , will depend on just how  high rjr  is forced to fix  the interest_6 rate  to get  the bonds  trading up to  par  . 
$$
 brunswick  also has  interests_5  in  defense  and  aerospace products  . 
$$
 market analysts  said that continued  declines  and  volatility  in  the stock market  contributed generally to  enhanced investor interest_1  in  precious metals  , but that  the british political news  was  the main factor  boosting  prices  :  chancellor  of  the exchequer nigel lawson  resigned . 
$$
but  he  also noted that if  uncertainty  continues in  the stock market  ,  that  might create  some investor interest_1  in  precious metals  . 
$$
 that interest_1  has been lacking for  a long time  ,  he  said . 
$$
 bert ruiz  ,  soft commodity specialist  at  balfour  ,  maclaine futures inc.  , said that  all week   he  has seen increasing  open interest_5  and  declining prices  --  an almost certain sign  that  additional selling  of  contracts  is taking  place  . 
$$
 open interest_5  is  the number  of  outstanding contracts   that  remain to be settled either by  an opposite trade  or  delivery  . 
$$
======================================  costa rica  also would be able to pay  overdue interest_6  on  its still-outstanding loans  at ``  more favorable terms  '' than  regular debtors  ,  other u.s. bankers  said . 
$$
======================================  these  pooled  investments  in  trusts  ,  which  drew  income  from  owned properties  or from  interest_6  on  mortgages  , were hit by  the real estate doldrums  of  that year  . 
$$
overbuilding ,  inflation  ,  high interest_6  and  materials costs  ,  mortgage defaults  and  some questionable lending practices  combined to hurt  reits  . 
$$
======================================  mr. osborne  said  maclean hunter holdings ltd.  , owned by  certain directors  and  subsidiaries  of  maclean hunter  , has  a voting interest_5  of about  20 %  in  the company  ;  no other holder  has as much as  10 %  . 
$$
 mr. lawson  carefully watched  exchange rates  and stood ready to increase  u.k. interest_6 rates  when  the pound  slid too sharply against  the dollar  or  the mark  . 
$$
======================================  republicans  would defer  the tax break  : save  $ 2,000  , and  you  'll escape  taxes  on  all the interest_6   that sum  earns over  the years  till  you  retire . 
$$
 balances  in  ira  and  keogh accounts  (  retirement accounts  for  the self-employed  ) ,  which  had swelled by  $ 75 billion  in  1986  , grew by only  $ 48 billion  in  1988  , including  interest_6  on  past contributions  . 
$$
but at  retirement 25 years  later ,  the entire $ 4,773  in  interest_6  could be withdrawn  taxfree  , along with  the  already taxed  $ 2,000 initial contribution  . 
$$
====================================== on  the other hand  ,  the case  for  delayed gratification  is bolstered by  evidence  that  a surprising number  of  upper-income americans  still are putting  money  in  iras  even though  the only tax break  is deferring  tax  on  the interest_6   the contributions  earn . 
$$
but allowing  the interest_6 buildup  on  those contributions  to escape  taxation  would cost  the treasury  far more than  that sum  in  the long run  ,  the congressional budget office  says . 
$$
 credit lyonnais  reported  1988 consolidated profit  of  2.06 billion francs  after  payments  to  minority interests_5  . 
$$
until yesterday ,  institutional investors  had showed  little interest_1  in buying  the securities  . 
$$
======================================  strips  are created by separating  the interest_6 payment portion  of  the bond  from  the principal portion  , called  the corpus  . 
$$
 zero-coupon securities  pay  no interest_6  until  maturity  , with  the return  to  investors  consisting primarily of  the bond discount  . 
$$
======================================  one basis  for  linking change  in  the east  and  change  in  the west  is  the notion  that integrating  110 million eastern europeans  with  320 million western europeans  is primarily  the task  of  europeans  , despite  the u.s. 's obvious strategic  and  economic interest_4  . 
$$
'' ======================================  he  adds that with  communism  collapsing and  mr. gorbachev  scrambling to rejuvenate  the soviet economy  , ``  our interest_4  lies in  a controlled transformation  ,  a contained nuclear reaction  , so  we  need to help  him  , and not just with  words  . 
$$
====================================== like  most treasury secretaries  ,  mr. brady  takes  a keen interest_1  in  monetary matters  , of  course  . 
$$
 he  was , in  fact  , taking  an  especially  keen interest_1  in  board matters  even before  he  went to  the treasury  . 
$$
====================================== in  recent weeks  , moreover ,  mr. brady  has joined  other administration officials  in trying to urge  the fed  toward  lower interest_6 rates  . 
$$
 the fed  has let  interest_6 rates  slip slightly , but whether  the main reason  was  dollar intervention  ,  the gloomy reports  on  manufacturing employment  , or  the friday 13 market drop  , only  mr. greenspan  and  his associates  know .

in  a decision  in  april  of  this year  ,  judge roger miner  , joined by  judge frank altimari  , agreed on denying  the injunction  and did not  doubt  that ``  bare-faced messiah  '' was  a serious work  but rejected  judge leval 's argument  that  the public interest_4  in  scholarship  could outweigh  the sanctity  of  copyright  . 
$$
'' ======================================  decisions  by  the second circuit itself  ,  judge oakes  continued , had recognized that  public interest_1  in  the subject matter  and  the indispensability  in  particular cases  of  verbatim quotations  are  vital components  of  fair use  . 
$$
yet  a bill  tailored to  the interests_4  of  a single individual  passed  congress  with  almost unimaginable speed  , before  the judicial process  had run  its course  , and , indeed , while  the morgan case  was awaiting  a ruling  by  the appellate court  .

$$
======================================  all  of  the bidders  contemplate  full payment including interest_6  to  secured creditors  . 
$$
======================================  geoffrey kalmus  ,  counsel  to  the official creditors committee  , said that under  the united illuminating plan  ,  unsecured creditors  would be paid in  full credits  and  interest_6  of about  $ 855 million  , accrued before  ps  of  new hampshire 's jan. 1988  filing for  bankruptcy court protection  . 
$$
in  addition  ,  they  would receive  some $ 200 million  in  payments  for  interest_6  since then . 
$$
 mr. kalmus  said that by  next july they  would have accrued  unpaid interest_6  equal to  $ 350 million  . 
$$
 other plans  generally would n't pay  unsecured creditors ' interest_6  accrued since  the filing  . 
$$
====================================== though obscure to  most investors  ,  the question  of whether to list  options  on more than  one exchange  has aroused  much interest_1  in  congress  , mainly because  regional exchanges  fear  the change  could bankrupt  them  . 
$$
======================================  the two-stroke engine displays  by  toyota  and  fuji heavy industries  ,  the maker  of  subaru cars  , drew plenty of  interest_1  from  u.s. auto executives  ,  who  are rushing to develop  two-stroke engines  . 
$$
but  the fed  is n't enthusiastic about  treasury efforts  to bring down  the value  of  the dollar  through  intervention  in  foreign-exchange markets  , and  the treasury  is frustrated at  the fed 's reluctance  to cut  interest_6 rates  to pull down  the dollar 's value  . 
$$
 many analysts  are expecting  the fed  to lower  interest_6 rates  at  least  once more before  the end  of  the year  . 
$$
======================================  the amount  covers  taxes  ,  interest_6  and  penalties  owed from  1966  , when  the state  began collecting  corporate taxes  , to  1985  . 
$$
======================================  short interest_5  in  international mobile machines corp.  fell to  3,102,935 shares  in  the month  ended  oct. 13  from  3,420,936  in  september  . 
$$
====================================== ( see : ``  short interest_5  in  otc stocks posts 6 % jump  --  rise  during  latest period  is  sharpest  since  april  ;  oct. 13 drop is n't factor  '' --  wsj oct. 25  ,  1989  . 
$$
====================================== `` with  the decline  in  stock prices  and continued  low  or  stable interest_6 rates  ,  stocks  are representing  a better value   all the time  , ''  renaissance president frank w. terrizzi  said yesterday . 
$$
on  top  of  this  ,  the traveler   who  converts  his dollars  into  foreign currency  before  the trip starts  will lose  interest_6  from  the day  of  conversion  . 
$$
in  the meantime  ,  the money  can continue to earn  interest_6  for  the card holder  -- often more than  1 %  during  that  ``  float  ''  period  alone . 
$$
====================================== ``  lower yields  are just reflecting  lower short-term interest_6 rates  , '' said  brenda malizia negus  ,  editor  of  money fund report  . 
$$
 money funds  invest in  such things  as  short-term treasury securities  ,  commercial paper  and  certificates  of  deposit  ,  all  of  which  have been posting  lower interest_6 rates  since  last spring  . 
$$
======================================  average maturity  was as short as  29 days  at  the start  of  this year  , when  short-term interest_6 rates  were moving steadily upward . 
$$
 that  's worse than  the price drop  sustained by  the bonds  in  its portfolio  ,  whose total return  (  bond-price changes  plus  interest_6  ) has amounted to  a negative 6.08 %  .

 large  ,  heterogeneous election districts  would encourage  good government  , said  madison  , because  a representative  would be compelled to serve  the interests_4  of  all his constituents  and be servile to  none  .

$$
======================================  the most recent otc short interest_5 statistics  were compiled  oct. 13  ,  the day   the nasdaq composite index  slid  3 %  and  the new york stock exchange  tumbled  7 %  . 
$$
however ,  the short interest_5 figures  reported by  brokerage  and  securities  clearing  firms  to  the national association  of  securities dealers  include only  those trades  completed , or settled , by  oct. 13  , rather than  trades   that  occurred on  that day  , according to  gene finn  ,  chief economist  for  the nasd  .

$$
 the sharp rise  in  otc short interest_5  compares with  the 4.2 % decline  in  short *interest  on  the new york stock exchange  and  the 3 % rise  on  the american stock exchange  during  the september-october period  .

$$
in  addition  ,  changes  in  short interest_5  in  some stocks  may be caused by  arbitrage  .

$$
======================================  economists  said  the bond market 's strength  also is  a sign  that  investors  expect  the federal reserve  to cut  interest_6 rates  amid  growing evidence  that  the economy  is slowing . 
$$
``  people  are looking  past supply  to  lower interest_6 rates  , but  they  're also worried about being whipsawed by  the volatility  in  the stock market  . 
$$
====================================== ``  interest_1  by  japanese investors  was limited , '' said  michael moran  ,  chief economist  at  daiwa securities america inc  . 
$$
'' ====================================== however ,  mr. moran  added that  the japanese  generally have  a positive view  of  the u.s. bond market  because of  expectations  that  the dollar  will remain  strong  and  interest_6 rates  will decline . 
$$
======================================  a small yield premium  over  comparable treasurys  and  a lack  of  liquidity  is hampering  dealers ' efforts  to drum up  interest_1  in  the so-called bailout bonds  . 
$$
======================================  corporate issues  ======================================  several blue-chip companies  tapped  the new-issue market yesterday  to take  advantage  of  falling interest_6 rates  .

$$
'' ======================================  a gm spokesman  yesterday reiterated  the company 's interest_1  in acquiring  a minority stake  to help  jaguar  remain  independent  . 
$$
======================================  gm 's interest_1  in  jaguar  reflects  a desire  to help diversify  the u.s. company 's products  in  the growing luxury-car segment  of  the market  .

$$
 a sinking economy  depresses  corporate earnings  and thus  stock prices  , but  it  buoys  bond prices  as  interest_6 rates  fall .

``  corporate profits  are going to decrease faster than  interest_6 rates  will fall , and  the probability  is that  we  'll see  negative economic growth  in  the fourth quarter  .

======================================  mr. goldston  ,  who  had been  president  of  faberge inc. 's faberge u.s.a. division  before joining  reebok  in  september 1988  , left in  august  to pursue  other interests_3  . 
$$
====================================== ``  it  was  a time  when  interest_6 rates  came down very rapidly , ''  dr. blumenfeld  recalls . 
$$
because  the cd  had  an effective yield  of  13.4 %  when  it  was issued in  1984  , and  interest_6 rates  in  general  had declined sharply since then ,  part  of  the price dr. blumenfeld  paid was  a premium  --  an additional amount  on  top  of  the cd 's base value  plus accrued  *interest   that  represented  the cd 's increased market value  . 
$$
 he  assumed that  principal  and  interest_6  were `` fully insured up to  $ 100,000  , ''  he  adds . 
$$
(  federal deposit insurance  would pay  principal  and  interest_6  accrued to  the date  of  liquidation  , to  a maximum  of  $ 100,000  . 
$$
====================================== because of  the tax consequences  of  zero-coupon investments  --  income tax  is payable in  the year interest_6  is accrued , although  *interest  is n't actually paid until  maturity  --  zero-coupon cds  are usually sold for  tax-advantaged accounts  to finance  things  like  retirement  and  children 's education  . 
$$
======================================  housing  and  urban development secretary jack kemp  called on  the federal reserve system  to lower  interest_6 rates  . 
$$
====================================== in  a speech  to  the mortgage bankers association  ,  mr. kemp  broke  the administration 's public silence  on  the fed  and complained that ``  interest_6 rates  are too high . 
$$
'' ====================================== ``  i  am convinced that  a monetary policy  for  this country   that  would return  interest_6 rates  to  the historical level  of  4 %  or  5 %  would have not only  an immediate impact  on  housing starts  ,  the housing stock  ,  our industry  in  america  ,  the refurbishing  of  our industrial system  ,  it  would help  the third world economies  considerably and  it  would particularly have  a favorable impact  upon  our budget deficit  , ''  mr. kemp  said . 
$$
======================================  the fed  recently eased  credit  by lowering  the bellwether federal funds interest_6 rate  to  8 34 %  from about  9 %  . 
$$
in  addition  ,  a norfolk affiliate  ,  york capital inc.  , will purchase  all  of  the interests_5  of  eagle 's secured lenders  ,  which  total  $ 11.5 million  , and guarantee as much as  $ 8.2 million  in  payments  to  eagle 's unsecured creditors  . 
$$
as  interest_6 rates  paid  depositors  were lowered ,  thrift withdrawals  exceeded  deposits  by  $ 5.1 billion  , not including  *interest  credited to  accounts  . 
$$
'' ====================================== for  the third quarter  , operating  profit  from  carbide 's chemicals  and  plastics business  fell to  $ 238 million  from  $ 352 million   a year  ago , before accounting for  taxes  and  interest_6 expense  .

$$
 the machinists ' criticisms  of  the labor-management bid  and  their threats  of  a strike  unless  they  received  substantial wage  increases  this year  helped  cool banks ' interest_1  in financing  the transaction  . 
$$
====================================== but  he  and  his chief financial officer  ,  john pope  , sowed  some  of  the seeds  for  the deal 's failure  by insisting  banks  accept  low financing fees  and  interest_6 rates  , while  they  invested in  the transaction  only  a small fraction  of  the $ 114.3 million   they  stood to gain from  sale  of  their ual stock  and  options  . 
$$
 the issue  includes  current interest_6 bonds due 1991-2000  ,  2009  ,  2012  ,  2014  and  2016  , and  capital appreciation bonds due 2001-2005  . 
$$
 the current interest_6 serial bonds  are priced to yield from  6.15 %  in  1991  to  7.10 %  in  2000  . 
$$
 interest_6  on  the bonds  will be treated as  a preference item  in calculating  the federal alternative minimum tax   that  may be imposed on  certain investors  . 
$$
in  an economic slowdown  ,  heavy debt loads  reduce  the flexibility  of  companies  because  cash   that  would normally be used to keep  the company buoyant  must be diverted to  interest_6 payments  . 
$$
 mr. goodson  , in  his own statement  , was less upbeat , saying `` unfortunately over  the past few years  ,  it  has become increasingly clear that  ralph  and  i  have  different agendas  , '' and that  he  feels `` more comfortable with  a management team   whose sole interest_3  and  responsibility  is in  the goodson papers  . 
$$
======================================  allianz  holds  a 50 % stake  in  navigation mixte 's insurance interests_5  , acquired  three weeks  ago . 
$$
 payment  by  allianz  for  the insurance  interests_5  it  has just bought will help swell  the french concern 's treasury  to  an estimated 11 billion francs  . 
$$
======================================  rockwell international corp.  bought out  ikegai corp. 's interest_5  in  ikegai-goss  ,  a joint venture  of  the two companies  based in  tokyo  . 
$$
 such news  is good for  bonds  because  economic weakness  sometimes causes  the federal reserve  to lower  interest_6 rates  in  an effort  to stimulate  the economy  and  stave  off  a recession  . 
$$
====================================== so far ,  money managers  and  other bond buyers  have n't shown  much interest_1  in  the refcorp bonds  . 
$$

$$
======================================  the purpose  of  the note  is to provide added  capital  for  the spun-off company  in  a form   that  will save  it   spending cash  on  immediate interest_6 payments  ,  mr. roulac  said . 
$$
======================================  the financial-services firm  , struggling since  summer  to avoid  a bankruptcy-law  filing after  missing interest_6 payments  on about  $ 1 billion  of  debt  , will retain  the right  to regain  the subsidiary  .

$$
in  his statement  ,  mr. skase  said  preliminary accounts  showed that  group profit  before  interest_6  ,  tax  and  depreciation  `` will exceed  a$ 170 million  .

====================================== though  the market  was stronger ,  dealers  said  fresh buying interest_1  was sidelined ahead of  a potential market-affecting debate  in  the house  of  commons set  for  tuesday  .

$$
although  prices  rallied  briefly  following  the tumble  on  world stock markets  earlier  this month  and  the related decline  of  the dollar  ,  precious metals  are out of  favor  for  the moment  because of  high interest_6 rates  and  a determination  by  industrial nations  to curb  inflation  ,  dealers  say . 
$$
but  their value  as  investments  can be decimated by  inflation  ,  which  erodes  the purchasing power  of  bonds ' fixed-dollar interest_6 payments  . 
$$
======================================  one suit  , filed by more than  three dozen investors  ,  charges  that  mr. peterson  misused much of  the $ 9.7 million  put into  a limited partnership  that  he  operated and promoted , spending  some  of  it  to pay  his own legal bills  and to invest in  other companies  in  which   he  had  an interest_5  . 
$$
like  other zeros  ,  they  pay  all their interest_6  at  maturity  , meaning that  buyers  can time  things  so that  their bonds  pay off just when  junior graduates  from  high school  . 
$$
 their price  falls further than that of  other bonds  when  inflation  and  interest_6 rates  kick up .

$$
or  an interest_5  in  a retirement community  in  nevada   that  will knock  your socks  off , once  it  is built . 
$$
====================================== between  1978  and  1987  , for  instance  ,  sh oil  in  winter haven  ,  fla.  , sold  interests_5  in  oil wells  to  a very select group  of  local residents  , while turning away  numerous other eager investors  . 
$$
 they  commonly give  two scenarios  :  one  is based on  interest_6 rates  that  the company  guarantees ( usually  4 %  to  4.5 %  ) and  the other  on  the rate   it  is currently getting on  investment  , often  8.5 %  or  more  . 
$$
====================================== projecting  the latter  over  several decades  ,  i  find  my cash buildup  is impressive -- but can  any high interest_6 rate  prevail for  that long  . 
$$
====================================== yes ,  he  says ,  premiums  on  such variable-rate coverage  can be structured to `` vanish '' after  a certain period  -- but usually only if  interest_6 rates  stay  high  enough to generate  sufficient cash  to cover  the annual cost  of  insurance protection  . 
$$
if  interest_6 rates  plunge ,  the insurer  may be knocking on  my door  , asking for  steeper premium payments  to maintain  the same amount  of  protection  . 
$$
======================================  some insurers  have also started offering ``  persistency  bonuses , '' such as  extra dividends  or  a  marginally  higher interest_6 yield  , if  the policy  is maintained for  10 years  . 
$$
at  age 65  , when  i  'd stop paying  premiums  ,  the ameritas offering  would have  a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher  than  the other  , even though  the equitable 's policy illustration  assumed  a  fractionally  higher interest_6 rate  . 
$$
====================================== buying  interest_1  also resurfaced in  the technology sector  , including  international business machines  ,  whose board  approved  a $ 1 billion increase  in  its stock buy-back program  . 
$$
====================================== in  a speech  prepared for  delivery  to  london 's financial community  ,  mr. lawson  summed up  current economic policy  as  a battle  to wring  inflation  out of  the british economy  , using  high interest_6 rates  as ``  the essential instrument  '' to carry out  the campaign  . 
$$
'' ====================================== in reaffirming  the current monetary policy  of using  high interest_6 rates  to fight  inflation  and  shore  up  the pound  ,  mr. lawson  dismissed  other approaches  to managing  the economy  . 
$$
while  lower joblessness  is generally  good news  ,  the hefty drop last month  indicates that  the economy  is n't slowing down as much as hoped -- despite  a doubling  of  interest_6 rates  over  the last 16 months  . 
$$
`` now  the interest_1  is in  what  else can  i  do with  that money  .

$$
 amex short interest_5  climbed  3 %  to  53,496,665 shares  from  51,911,566 shares  . 
$$
======================================  amex short interest_5  has been heading upward since  mid-december  , with  increases  in  each month  since then except at  mid-july  . 
$$
======================================  short interest_5  is  the number  of  shares   that  have n't yet been purchased for  return  to  lenders  . 
$$
although  a substantial short position  reflects  heavy speculation  that  a stock 's price  will decline ,  some investors  consider  an increase  in  short interest_5  bullish because  the borrowed shares  eventually must be bought back . 
$$
======================================  fluctuation  in  short interest_5  of  certain stocks  also may be caused partly by arbitraging . 
$$
======================================  the level  of  negative sentiment  measured by  the big board short interest_5 ratio  slipped to  3.36  from  last month  's  3.38  . 
$$
======================================  short interest_5  in  international business machines corp.  plunged to  1,425,035 shares  from  2,387,226 shares   a month  earlier .

======================================  the amex short interest_5 volume leader  again was  texas air corp.  , rising to  3,820,634 shares  from  3,363,949  . 
$$
======================================  the adjacent tables  show  the big board  and  amex issues  in  which   a short interest_5 position  of at  least 100,000 shares  existed as of  mid-october  or in  which there  was  a short position change  of at  least 50,000 shares  since  mid-september  .

======================================  textron  said that  nine-months ' results  do n't include  earnings  of  avdel plc  ,  a british maker  of  industrial fasteners  , but do include  interest_6 costs  of  $ 16.4 million  on  borrowings  related to  the proposed purchase  of  avdel  . 
$$
======================================  stock-market fears  and relatively  more attractive interest_6 rates  pushed  money-market mutual fund assets  up  $ 6.07 billion  in  the latest week  ,  the sharpest increase  in almost  two years  . 
$$
so  the bank 's board  decided to make  1.23 billion malaysian dollars  (  us$ 457 million  ) in  provisions  for  interest_6 payments  from  loans  previously recorded as  revenue  but never actually received by  the bank  , and to submit  a bailout package  to replenish  the bank 's paid-up capital  . 
$$
but  public documents  indicate  10 %  or  more  of  the bank 's provisions  were made for  foregone interest_6  on  a m$ 200 million loan  to  malaysia 's dominant political party  ,  the united malays national organization  , to build  its convention  and  headquarters complex  in  kuala lumpur  . 
$$
 bond prices  also jumped as  traders  appeared to read  the data  as  a sign  that  interest_6 rates  may fall . 
$$
 the steep climb  in  producer prices  reported  last friday  fostered  pessimism  about  lower interest_6 rates  and contributed to  the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge   that day  . 
$$
in  the past several days  , however ,  the u.s. 's central bank  has allowed  a key interest_6 rate  to fall slightly to try to stabilize  the markets  .

======================================  the glazer group  said in  a securities  and  exchange commission  filing in  early october  that  it  may seek  a controlling interest_5  in  harley-davidson  , or seek  representation  on  the company 's board  .

'' ======================================  the reason  is  simple  ,  mr. wyss  says : ``  interest_6 rates  almost always decline during  recession  . 
$$
'' as surely as  a seesaw  tilts , falling  interest_6 rates  force up  the price  of previously issued  bonds  . 
$$
 they  are worth more because  they  pay  higher interest_6  than newly issued  bonds  do .

when  *interest rates  have dropped ,  it  makes  sense  for  corporations  to do just  that  ;  they  then save on  interest_6 costs  .

during  settlement talks  , for  example  ,  warner  demanded  such things  as  cable tv rights  to  columbia movies  and  columbia 's interest_5  in  the studio   it  jointly owns with  warner  , according to  executives  involved in  the talks  .

======================================  cost  and  expenses  for  the quarter  , excluding  interest_6  , increased  6.1 %  to  $ 333.3 million  from  $ 314 million   the year  before . 
$$
but in  the light  of  events  in  panama  , where  the u.s.  has  such clear strategic interests_4  , waiting for  the delta force  may prove to be  a dangerous gambit  . 
$$
 a year  earlier ,  the company  had  profit  from  discontinued operations  of  $ 24.9 million  from  sale  of  a pipeline  ,  a refinery  and  an interest_5  in  a second refinery  .

======================================  a new product  ,  newsedge  , carries  five business news wires  simultaneously into  a user 's computer  and  beeps  and  flashes  whenever  an article  appears  that  is of  interest_2  to  the user  . 
$$
====================================== moreover ,  individual inc. 's computers  can weigh  the value  of  an article  based on how closely  the story  matches  the subscriber 's interest_3 area  . 
$$
======================================  hot topic  :  interest_1  in  the abortion issue  is so great that  the hotline  ,  a daily  ,  computer-distributed political newsletter  , comes up with  a spinoff product  called  the abortion report  dealing solely with  its political implications  . 
$$
======================================  rumors  of  soviet interest_1  also pushed up  the prices  of  soybean futures contracts  . 
$$
======================================  analysts  said  they  were impressed by  the performance  of  the company 's newspaper group  ,  which  consists of  the times  ,  35 regional newspapers  and  a one-third interest_5  in  the international herald tribune  ;  group operating profit  for  the quarter  increased slightly to  $ 34.9 million  from  $ 34.5 million  on  flat revenue  . 
$$
but  the economy  `` is slowing enough to give  the federal reserve leeway  to reduce  interest_6 rates  . 
$$
 the theory  relies on  three assumptions  : ======================================  1  )  voters  can `` buy ''  one  of  two brands  when  they  select  their political agents  --  a republican brand   that  believes in  the minimalist state  and in  the virtues  of  private markets  over  the vices  of  public action  , and  a democratic brand   that  believes in  big government  and in  public intervention  to remedy  the excesses  attendant to  the pursuit  of  private interest_4  . 
$$
======================================  michael f. harris  ,  53  , was named  executive vice president  ,  north america  , for  the financial times  ,  the business newspaper  published by  this company  that also has  interests_5  in  book  publishing ,  fine china  ,  oil services  and  investment banking  .

$$
====================================== in  a joint statement  ,  the two companies  ,  whose combined holdings equal 52.7 %  of  sun life 's ordinary shares  , said  their agreement  is aimed at reducing ``  the uncertainty  and  instability  for  sun life   that  has resulted from  two major shareholders  owning ''  a controlling interest_5  in  the company  . 
$$
======================================  schlumberger ltd.  ,  new york  , reported  third-quarter net income  edged up as  growth  in  its oil-field services sector  offset  a decline  in  interest_6 income  . 
$$
======================================  the lower interest_6 income  occurred because  schlumberger  spent  $ 1.2 billion  buying back  its stock last year  . 
$$
======================================  dumez  said  group profit  after  payments  to  minority interests_5  rose to  252 million francs  (  $ 40.1 million  ) from  148 million   a year  earlier . 
$$
====================================== for  all  of  1988  ,  dumez  had  group profit  of  452 million francs  after  payment  to  minority interests_5  .

$$
 the gain  resulted from  the sale  of  grace equipment co.  ,  the initial public offering  of  a one-sixth interest_5  in  grace energy corp.  and  an adjustment  in  the carrying value  of  certain natural resource assets  not  part  of  grace energy  . 
$$

$$
======================================  the fletcher challenge canada stake  was then canceled ,  doman  said , raising  doman 's interest_5  in  western forest  to  56 %  . 
$$
 doman  said  it  was also granted  an option  to acquire  the  remaining  44 % interest_5  in  western forest  ,  which  is currently held by  two canadian banks  . 
$$
====================================== but  traders  said  the market  lacks  a base  on  which  to set  long-term buying strategy  , as  the future direction  of  u.s. interest_6 rates  remains  unclear  . 
$$
====================================== ``  investor interest_1 switches  back and forth ceaselessly as  they  are unable to shift  their weight  to  one side  for  sure  , ''  mr. mitsuoka  of  daiwa investment trust  said . 
$$
====================================== leading  construction companies  also attracted  interest_1  for  their strong earnings outlooks  ,  traders  said .

$$
====================================== in  a filing  with  the securities  and  exchange commission  ,  mr. gintel  said  xtra  `` has pursued  business strategies   that  are n't in  the best interest_4  of  stockholders  . 
$$
======================================  stocks  and  bonds surged  on  the second anniversary  of  black monday  as  a favorable inflation report  prompted  speculation  of  lower interest_6 rates  . 
$$
 the rapid recovery  continued to be fueled by  growth  in  consumer loans  ,  higher interest_6 margins  and  only minor loan losses  . 
$$
======================================  big board short interest_5  fell  4.2 %  for  the month  ended  oct. 13  ,  the second decline  in  a row  . 
$$
====================================== but  foreign-exchange dealers  said  the dollar  staged  a quick comeback  , prompted by  a round  of  short  covering and  some fresh buying interest_1  later in  the trading day  . 
$$
====================================== ``  the fed  wo n't be stampeded into easing , ''  mr. logan  said , predicting that for now ,  interest_6 rates  will stay where  they  are . 
$$
======================================  the hotels  and  management interests_5  will be sold at  an auction  , said  john rothman  ,  president  and  chief executive officer  of  the trust  and  a director  of  the corporation  .

======================================  thursday  ,  october 19  ,  1989  ======================================  the key u.s.  and  foreign annual interest_6 rates  below are  a guide  to  general levels  but do n't always represent  actual transactions  . 
$$
======================================  first fidelity bancorp.  ,  lawrenceville  ,  n.j.  , reported  a 24 % drop  in  third-quarter profit  , because of  a decline  in earning  assets  ,  lower loan volume  and  tighter interest_6 margins  . 
$$
====================================== ( see : ``  marketing brief  --  viacom inc.  :  third-period loss widened  ;  interest_6 expense  is  cited  '' --  wsj oct. 19  ,  1989  . 
$$
======================================  the defense electronics concern  attributed  the operating improvement  to  higher profit margins  and  lower net interest_6 expense  . 
$$
 healthvest  missed  an interest_6 payment  to  bank  of  tokyo  on  oct. 1  . 
$$
======================================  healthvest  is in  a severe liquidity bind  because  its affiliate  ,  healthcare international inc.  , has failed to make about  $ 10.6 million  in  principal  and  interest_6 payments  owed since  august  . 
$$
======================================  lin  would have  a priority right  to pursue  all opportunities  to acquire  u.s. cellular interests_5  in  markets  other than  those  in  which mccaw  holds  an *interest  , or  which  are contiguous to  those markets  , unless  lin  has  an *interest  there or  contiguous  to  it  .

 independent directors  would have  veto rights  to  any acquisition  if  they  unanimously decide  it  is n't in  lin 's best interest_4  .

 the directors  would be able to sell  particular assets  to enable  such buyers  as  the regional bell  operating  companies  to purchase  the company 's interests_5  .

$$
======================================  bankamerica corp.  reported  a 34 % jump  in  third-quarter earnings  , as  its rocket-like recovery  from nearly  ruinous losses several years  ago continued to be fueled by  growth  in  consumer loans  ,  higher interest_6 margins  and  negligible loan losses  . 
$$
but  that drop  was caused entirely by  a decline  in  brazilian interest_6  paid , to  $ 5 million  from  $ 54 million   the second quarter  . 
$$
 the 4.52 % net interest_6 margin  , or  the difference  between  the yield  on  a bank 's investments  and  the rate   it  pays for  deposits  and  other borrowings  , was still markedly higher than  the 3.91 % ratio   a year  earlier , and is among  the best  in  the industry  ,  analysts  said . 
$$
 canadian pacific  ,  which  has  interests_5  in  transportation  ,  telecommunications  ,  forest products  ,  energy  and  real estate  , finally took  its majority block  off  the market   this spring  . 
$$
'' ======================================  martin h. ruby  ,  a managing director  of  capital holding 's accumulation  and  investment group  , also resigned to pursue  other business interests_3  ,  capital holding  said . 
$$
``  i  do n't believe in  the airline business   you  can be totally laissez-faire because of  the high degree  of  public interest_4  '' at  stake  . 
$$
======================================  institutions  , meanwhile , stepped back to  the sidelines  as  the direction  of  u.s. interest_6 rates  remained  unclear  . 
$$
 the impact  on  japanese insurers  and  property owners  with  interests_5  in  the san francisco area  is still being assessed ,  they  said . 
$$
with  uncertainty  still hanging over  interest_6 rates  and  the dollar  ,  the market  failed to find  a focus   that  might lead to further  investor commitments  ,  they  said . 
$$
======================================  interest_6 rate-sensitive shares  such as  steel  ,  construction  and  electric utility companies  ,  which  rose early in  the week  , saw  their advance  weaken yesterday . 
$$
 the industry  had shown  signs  of  recovery   this summer  , after  the central bank  began to relax  its clamp  on  credit  , allowing  interest_6 rates  to drop  a bit  after pushing  them  up for  a year  . 
$$
 net  also was aided by  a gain  on  the sale  of  the company 's equity interests_5  in  south africa effective sept. 1  . 
$$
====================================== in  the period  ,  the company  completed  the sale  of  its european cosmetics businesses  , sold  a majority interest_5  in  its brazilian affiliate  , and announced  the reorganization  of  its over-the-counter drug businesses  into  a new unit  ,  schering-plough health care products  . 
$$
======================================  affiliated bankshares  of  colorado inc.  said  it  agreed to sell  its 10 % interest_5  in  rocky mountain bankcard systems  for  $ 18.5 million  to  colorado national bank  of  denver  and  central bank  of  denver  . 
$$
 the fed  is easily assigned  the blame  for  unpleasantness  , like  high interest_6 rates  or  slow economic growth  , while  the politicians  can escape  responsibility  by pointing to  the fed 's independence  . 
$$
 the problem  is not that  the fed  is too unresponsive to  the public interest_4  . 
$$
on  the contrary  ,  it  is too responsive to  an incorrect view  of  the public interest_4  . 
$$
 he  has  a built-in  ,  constant longing  for  lower interest_6 rates  . 
$$
or would  he  interpret  it  as  instruction  to give  more weight  to  these other objectives  that  the secretary  represents --  low interest_6 rates  ,  short-run economic expansion  , and  stabilization  of  exchange rates  at internationally managed  levels  . 
$$
======================================  the bank 's medium-term  and  long-term loans  to  less-developed countries  total  $ 293 million  , of  which   $ 146 million  are n't accruing  interest_6  ,  the bank  said . 
$$
 the company  ,  which  is retaining most of  its wine  and  all  of  its soft-drink interests_5  , did n't  break  out  results  for  the businesses   it  plans to sell . 
$$
======================================  whitbread  now intends to bolster  its brewing interests_5  , in  an effort  to grab  a share  of  sales  to  free houses  . 
$$
in  britain  ,  those interests_5  include  the beefeater steakhouse chain  and  joint ownership  with  pepsico inc.  of  the country 's pizza hut chain  . 
$$
======================================  speculation  that  the federal reserve  will lower  interest_6 rates  in coming  weeks  helped push  the dollar  down  while  boosting  stocks  ,  traders  said . 
$$
======================================  amr 's board  , in  a statement  after  a regular meeting yesterday  , said : ``  ill-considered  and  reckless acquisition proposals  adversely affect  employee  ,  financial  and  business relationships  and are contrary to  the best interests_4  of  amr shareholders  .

 mr. hayes  ,  52 years  old ,  left southwestern bell telephone co.  in  january  , where  he  had been  chairman  ,  president  and  chief executive  , to join  triad capital partners  ,  a st. louis company  with  interests_5  in  solid waste  and recycling ,  telecommunications  and  international venture capital  . 
$$
 such high-yield debt  is similar to  a zero-coupon bond  in that  it  is sold at  a discount  to  face value  , with  interest_6  accruing instead of being paid to  the holder  . 
$$
under  current rules  ,  that  accrued  interest_6  is deductible by  the company  issuing  the debt  . 
$$
for  example  , if  a company  posted  a loss  of  $ 100 million  from  buy-out interest_6 payments  ,  the existing rule  would allow  the concern  to be able to receive  a refund  from  the tax   it  paid from  1986  through  1989  , when  it  may have been  a profitable public company  . 
$$
======================================  one possible solution  for  wall street  is to increase  the equity part  of  the transaction  --  that  is , give  lenders   a bigger stake  in  the surviving company  rather than just  interest_6 payments  . 
$$
since  they  have  a lower interest_6 rate  ,  they  would n't fall under  the junk-bond category   that  would lose  its deductibility  . 
$$
 the house version  of  the bill  would make  debt  non-deductible if  it  pays  five percentage points  above  treasury notes  , has at  least a five-year maturity  and does n't pay  interest_6  for at  least one year  out of  the first five  . 
$$
 the senate bill  would only deny  the deduction  until  interest_6  is actually paid . 
$$
====================================== currently , even though  the issuer  does n't pay  tax  ,  the debt holder  is taxed on  the accrued interest_6  . 
$$
``  the interest_6 deduction  was  the engine   that  made  these things  more productive . 
$$
 northrop 's interest_6 expense  also soared to  $ 35 million  from  $ 17 million   a year  ago . 
$$
 its interest_6 expense  surged to  $ 21.5 million  from  $ 12.4 million  . 
$$
======================================  mr. maynard  is n't  the first entrepreneur  to bump up against  entrenched interests_4  . 
$$
'' ====================================== despite  recent declines  in  interest_6 rates  ,  money funds  continue to offer  better yields  than  other comparable investments  . 
$$
 the s&l bailout  could cost  $ 300 billion  , computing  interest_6  on  the government 's loans  . 
$$
====================================== in  addition  ,  hunter  said  it  will use  proceeds  from  a private placement  of  $ 8 million  of  preferred shares  to purchase  an interest_5  in  a start-up company  to underwrite  environmental impairment insurance  . 
$$
 ford  has signaled  it  might acquire  a majority interest_5  later . 
$$
 the  refinancing of  $ 481 million  in  long-term debt  reduced  net income  by  $ 22 million  , or  five cents   a share  , but in  the long run  will save more than  $ 250 million  in  interest_6 costs  . 
$$
 the decision  to increase  the loan-loss  reserve and suspend  the dividend  is ``  both prudent  and in  the best long-term interest_4  of  the shareholders  , ''  he  said . 
$$
 initial interest_6 rate  set at  0.375 point  over  three-month libor  . 
$$
 interest_6 payments  on  the bonds  will be payable semiannually . 
$$
at  the state  and  local level  ,  the bonds  are subject to  surtaxes  and  estate  ,  inheritance  and  gift taxes  , but  exempt  from  taxation  as to  principal  and  interest_6  . 
$$
`` if  the stock market tremors  are behind  us  , then  the bond market  will go back to looking at  the next batch  of  economic numbers  to determine '' where  interest_6 rates  are heading . 
$$
 interest_6 rates  barely budged from  tuesday 's levels  . 
$$
 he  said , while  dialogue  is important ,  enough forums  already exist `` in  which   different interests_3  '' can express  themselves  . 
$$
not just that  people  are being heard but that  their interests_4  are being taken seriously .

$$
 such disclosures  of  big holdings  often are used by  raiders  to try to scare  a company 's managers  , and to stir  interest_1  in  the stock  . 
$$
======================================  the $ 55 million gain  on  the sale  was offset by  lower interest_6 income  ,  poorer results  from  foreign-exchange  trading and  a $ 9 million loss  on  the sale  of  a unit  ,  securities settlement corp  . 
$$
======================================  viacom inc.  ,  new york  , reported that  its third-quarter loss  widened to  $ 21.7 million  , or  41 cents   a share  , primarily because of  interest_6 expense  of  $ 70.1 million  . 
$$
 interest_6 expense  in  the 1988 third quarter  was  $ 75.3 million  . 
$$

 the joint venture  is being  undone  , with  mccall 's magazine  being sold  last summer  to  the new york times co. 's magazine group  for about  $ 80 million  , and  time warner  agreeing to sell back  its 50 % interest_5  in  working woman  and  working mother  to  mr. lang  . 
$$
======================================  the sale price  of  mccall 's  -- twice  what   mr. lang  originally paid for  it  -- will finance  lang communications ' buy-back  of  time warner 's 50 % interest_5  in  working woman  and  working mother  .

$$
 the higher rates  paid on  deposits  also helped squeeze  ncnb 's net interest_6 margin  in  the southeast  to  3.38 %  from  3.80 %   a year  earlier . 
$$
 the company  said  the gain  resulted mainly from  a $ 54 million increase  in  net interest_6 income  , reflecting  a 33 % increase  in  real estate loans  ( mainly  residential  ) , and  a 19 % rise  in  consumer loans  . 
$$

======================================  the federal reserve  gave  comfort  to  the financial markets  yesterday by allowing  a key interest_6 rate  to drift downward . 
$$
======================================  the fed  allowed  the key federal funds interest_6 rate  to dip to about  8 5 %  from  its levels  of just below  9 % last week  . 
$$
 government officials  say  it  's unclear , however , where  the bellwether  fed  funds rate  ,  which  influences  other interest_6 rates  , will come to rest . 
$$
for  weeks  prior to  the market 's drop  ,  the treasury  had been urging  the fed  to bring down  short-term interest_6 rates  , and  the fed  had been resisting . 
$$
 the fed  already is experiencing  political pressure  to supply  lower interest_6 rates  and  easy money  . 
$$
 there  is  the constant insistence  that  the fed  could lower  interest_6 rates  were  it  not so obstinate . 
$$
 the fed  indeed can lower  short-term interest_6 rates  by pumping  reserves  into  the banks  , but  it  ca n't do much about  them  from there on . 
$$
if  the reserves  generate  inflation  ,  which  is  what   the fed fears  most right now ,  interest_6 rates  will go up as  lenders  demand  a premium  . 
$$

$$
if  the yen rebounds  against  the dollar  ,  he  said ,  there  is  less chance  of  an additional increase  in  interest_6 rates  ,  which  could help stabilize  tokyo share prices  . 
$$
 analysts  say  one point  in  tokyo 's favor   this time  is  the fact  that for  the past several weeks   the market  has been in relatively  low gear  , driven by  fundamental concerns  about  earnings  and  interest_6 rates  rather than  wild speculation  . 
$$
after  the one-point rise oct. 5  to  15 %  ,  britain 's base interest_6 rate  stands at  its highest level  in  eight years  . 
$$
 a market plunge  in  britain  could bring  pressure  for  him  to lower  interest_6 rates  . 
$$
'' ======================================  lockheed 's share price  on  the new york stock exchange  has been propped up in  recent weeks  , despite  disappointing earnings  , because of  mr. simmons 's interest_1  in  the company  . 
$$
 the reasons  include  the obvious differences  in  the market  between  this fall  and  1987  :  interest_6 rates  have n't been rising  this time  , as  they  were in  1987  ;  the dollar  , though hit  friday  ,  has n't  been eroding dangerously ;  the economy  is n't overheating ; and , above  all  ,  stocks  are far from being as wildly overpriced :  they  are selling at only about  13 times per-share earnings  , compared with about  20 two years  ago . 
$$
 many traders  think  the fed  will quickly lower  interest_6 rates  ,  a move   that  would be  a plus  for  stocks  . 
$$
 any move  to lower  interest_6 rates  , for  example  , would be  a positive  for  stocks  , by  making fixed-income investments  less competitive with  them  . 
$$
====================================== in  1987  ,  then-treasury secretary james baker  was threatening  a big drop  in  the dollar  if  west germany  raised  interest_6 rates  . 
$$
 this year  ,  federal reserve chairman alan greenspan  seemed to warn  he  would n't lower  interest_6 rates  merely to keep  the dollar  within  an agreed-on exchange range  .

$$
`` while  a number  of  lbos  are fine ,  there  are also many where  the cash flow  can not pay  the interest_6  , but {  that  } instead are based on  the buyer  selling  divisions  to  a greater fool  to pay off  the debt  , ''  mr. icahn  says .

because  buy-out loans  often get refinanced -- and thus paid off -- ahead of  schedule  ,  banks  ca n't count on  years  of  interest_6 income  from  these loans  .

$$
 many analysts  also suspect that  the federal reserve  has begun to reduce  interest_6 rates  and could go further . 
$$
 lower interest_6 rates  usually diminish  a currency 's appeal  to  international investors  and  speculators  .

$$
======================================  september 's steep rise  in  producer prices  shows  that inflation  still persists , and  the pessimism  over  interest_6 rates  caused by  the new price data  contributed to  the stock market 's plunge friday  .

 analysts  immediately viewed  the price data  ,  the grimmest inflation news  in  months  , as  evidence  that  the federal reserve  was unlikely to allow  interest_6 rates  to fall as  many investors  had hoped .

====================================== since  1986  , when  congress  passed  landmark legislation  overhauling  the u.s. tax code  ,  u.s. multinationals  have been required to allocate  interest_6 expenses  on  a consolidated basis  . 
$$
 the effect  for  many companies  has been to increase  the effective cost  of  debt financing  , because  interest_6 expenses  allocated against  foreign income  `` crowd out ''  tax credits   that  otherwise might be available .

====================================== thus ,  interest_6 expenses  in  the u.s.  must now be allocated  prorata  to  foreign-based assets  . 
$$
however , by setting up  ford holdings  , and selling  the 25 % stake  making  it   a stand-alone unit  under  the tax law  ,  ford  is n't required to consolidate  these interest_6 expenses  and can preserve  its foreign tax credits  .

 john gross  ,  president  of  j.e. gross  &  associates  ,  a copper industry advisory firm  based in  new city  ,  n.y.  , noted  that tonnage  represented by  11,313 contracts  of  open interest_5  in  december options  on  copper futures  must be added . 
$$
======================================  that  makes  the total open interest_5  in  copper futures  and  options  equal to  378,326 tons  . 
$$
 the wide disparity  between  open interest_5  and  deliverable supplies  is n't as great as  the numbers  suggest because  the vast majority  of  futures contracts  are simply nullified by offsetting  trades  and  most option contracts  typically expire  unexercised  . 
$$
in  recent months  ,  similar  potentially  tight supply vs. open interest_5 situations  have been resolved without  delivery problems  .

====================================== also ,  mr. gross  noted ,  copper options  expire in  november  , so  the pressure  of  that open interest_5  will be relieved  a month  before  any delivery crunch  occurs in  futures  .

$$
thus ,  many investment managers  are buying mainly  shorter-term issues  ,  those due  in  five years  or  less  , because  they  think  long-term interest_6 rates  wo n't fall as much as  short-term rates  .

$$
====================================== `` here in  europe  ,  everybody  was expecting  the bundesbank  to raise  interest_6 rates  ;  a full point  was  a surprise  , but that  something  had to be done was clear to  everybody  , '' said  aloys bischofberger  ,  chief economist  for  credit suisse  in  zurich  . 
$$
while  japan 's central bank  is willing to let  market interest_6 rates  edge higher ,  they  contend that  the ruling liberal democratic party 's political status  remains too delicate to risk  upsetting  either  japan 's economic growth  or  its stock market  with  higher official *interest rates  . 
$$
====================================== supporting  the dollar  in  the face  of  the central banks ' efforts  to tame  it  are  a strong u.s. economy  , still relatively  high u.s. interest_6 rates  compared with  those  in  germany  and  japan  , and  foreigners ' notion  that  the u.s.  , as  mr. dennis  of  james capel  put  it  , `` appears very stable politically in  a world   that  appears very unstable  this year  .

$$
====================================== in  tokyo  ,  interest_6 rate worries  were muted and  stocks  rolled up  their second consecutive gain  , helped by  institutional  and  investment trust fund  buying near  the close  . 
$$
'' ====================================== according to  traders  ,  the rate rise  heightened already  strong fears  that  u.k. corporate profits  will be harmed by  high interest_6 rates  . 
$$
``  the market  ca n't go on making out  that higher interest_6 rates  are n't going to seriously harm  a lot  of  companies ' earnings  , ''  one dealer  said . 
$$
======================================  concern  over  currency fluctuations  and  expectations  of  the west german interest_6 rate increase  encouraged  investors  to `` get on and then off quickly on  one issue  after  another  , ''  a trader  at  dai-ichi securities  said , describing  an aggressive desire  to take  profits  quickly . 
$$
======================================  sugar refiners  attracted buying  interest_1  after  a local news report  pointed out  an improvement  in  sugar prices  over  the past few months  . 
$$
======================================  the state-controlled commercial bank group  said  group profit  rose to  1.49 billion francs  (  $ 233.2 million  ) from  1.24 billion francs   a year  earlier , and was ahead  16 %  after  payments  to  minority interests_5  at  1.37 billion francs  .

======================================  the west german bundesbank  raised  its official interest_6 rates  by  a full percentage point   each  in  a determined effort  to boost  the mark  and  cool  off  europe 's largest economy  before  inflationary pressures  multiply .

======================================  the full-point increases  lift  west germany 's benchmark interest_6 rates  to  their highest level  since  1982  , when  its economy  was still struggling to emerge from  the last recession  .

`` but if  you  do  that  to  an airline  ,  it  's  a real blow  to  the public interest_4  .

$$
 the company  defaulted in  interest_6 payments  in  sept  . 
$$
======================================  the pound 's relentless slide  stirred  the bank  of  england  to mount  a global-market intervention  and may soon force  british chancellor  of  the exchequer nigel lawson  to push through  another increase  in  british interest_6 rates  --  the 11th  since  june 1988  . 
$$
====================================== behind  the turmoil  is  an expected decision today  by  the west german bundesbank  to boost  key interest_6 rates  . 
$$
if  the bank  of  england 's market interventions  do n't shore up  the relative value  of  sterling  , ``  the only thing   he   's  got left is  interest_6 rates  , '' said  shearson lehman hutton analyst adam bennett  . 
$$
 mr. lawson  has attacked  this problem  by  raising interest_6 rates  so  consumers  buy  fewer goods  from abroad . 
$$
 the peril  is that  continuous  ratcheting up of  interest_6 rates  will produce  a more punishing downturn  than  the government  wants . 
$$
but  it  reasoned that  lawyers  should be liable for  emotional distress  when  their clients  have  a substantial emotional interest_1  at  stake  . 
$$
because  interest_6 rates  on  credit  are prohibitive ,  he  often forgoes  fertilizers  and instead relies on  crop rotation  to help restore  nutrients  to  the soil  :  some fields  are planted with  soy  ,  wheat  ,  corn  and  sunflower  for  several years  , and then returned to pasture for  the cattle  . 
$$
 the second  is  the willingness  of  the u.s.s.r.  to commit  itself  to  the discipline  of  confining government deficits  to  the level  limited by  the gold payments  of  principal  and  interest_6  required of  the gold bonds  . 
$$
 this  means that  the current domestic deficit  must be financed with  bonds  ,  which  of  course  become readily marketable in  moscow  ,  leningrad  ,  new york  and  london  if  the bonds  carry  the promise  to pay  principal  and  interest_6  in  gold  . 
$$
indeed ,  i  would expect  the soviet union  could step to  the front  of  the line  in  seeking credit  at  the lowest possible interest_6 rate  . 
$$
 i  would bet  such bonds  would be snapped up around  3 %  ,  which  would be  the lowest governmental interest_6 rate  on  earth  , including  japan 's  . 
$$
as  markets  gain  experience  with  soviet gold-backed bonds  ,  interest_6  on  the bonds  could be expected to decline , perhaps approaching  2 %  ,  the going rate  for  u.s. gold-mining-company gold bonds  . 
$$
======================================  what interest_6 rate  would  soviet bonds  need if  the gosbank  had  an independent monetary power  similar to  the fed  . 
$$
for  instance  , if  soviet inflation  is currently at  10 %  , then  the expected interest_6 rate  would be initially around  18 %  . 
$$
if  the inflation rate  is higher , then  it  would take proportionally  higher interest_6 rates  to stabilize  the rate  of  inflation  . 
$$
====================================== ``  this  has already dragged on  a lot  longer than expected , and  we  have {  an interest_6 payment  }  coming dec. 15  , ''  mr. ross  added . 
$$
====================================== for  instance  ,  new borrowers  in  the guaranteed student-loan program  would have to pay  higher origination fees  , and  lenders  would be paid at  a lower interest_6 rate  , in  order  to save  money  . 
$$
 the certificates  are n't  certificates  of  deposit  ,  the guarantee  is n't  federal deposit insurance  , and  the bonus interest_6 rates  are good for only  the first three months  on  one  - and  two-year investments  . 
$$
 people   who  express  interest_1  in  the certificates  receive  a detailed prospectus  . 
$$
'' ======================================  american express  obviously has  a big interest_4  in protecting  that reputation  . 
$$
 it  's  an annuity  --  a type  of  tax-advantaged retirement savings  plan --  whose appeal  is augmented by  an eye-catching first-year interest_6 rate  of  12 %  . 
$$
 they  offer  interest_6 rates   that  are fixed at  the time  of  purchase  . 
$$
 oil producers  ,  banana farmers  ,  pineapple growers  ,  cattlemen  were among  the objects  of  the committee 's interests_3  . 
$$
 this volatile source  of  liquidity  from  deposit brokers  seeking  high interest_6 rates  contributed to  current s&l insolvencies  . 
$$
 the notes  are  zero-coupon securities  and will not pay  interest_6  periodically . 
$$
======================================  california housing finance agency  --  $ 79.2 million  of  home mortgage revenue bonds  ,  1989 series e  , with  current interest_6 bonds due 1993-1999  ,  2009  ,  2019  and  2029  , and  capital appreciation bonds due 2000-2005  , tentatively priced by  a merrill lynch capital markets group  to yield from  6.50 %  in  1993  to  7.70 %  in  2029  . 
$$
 interest_6  on  the bonds  will be treated as  a preference item  in calculating  the federal alternative minimum tax  . 
$$
 there  is  no potential  for  negative amortization  , because  homeowners  must make up  interest_6 shortfalls  in  cash  . 
$$
 foresters  express  great interest_1  in knowing about  the redwoods you  mention in  oregon 's cascade mountains  , as  redwoods  grow in  coastal regions  of  northern california  and  southern oregon  . 
$$
 wall street 's rise  to  a record  close  tuesday  and  its strong opening yesterday  were outweighed by  continued weakness  in  the pound  ,  which  sharpened  fears  that  u.k. interest_6 rates  might soon rise . 
$$
but  some  said  a prospective interest_6 rate increase  by  the bundesbank  is already reflected in  current dollar rates  , so  an announcement  of  a rate rise today  might have  little effect  . 
$$
======================================  investor interest_1  yesterday centered on  companies whose share prices  are low in  relation  to  their property holdings  . 
$$
but  investor interest_1  ,  which  blossomed in  early  trading , `` dried up almost completely in  the afternoon  , ''  one trader  said . 
$$
 an increase  in  west german interest_6 rates  would put  pressure  on  u.k. rates  to follow  suit  . 
$$
======================================  grand metropolitan  was  6  higher at  604  on talk that  financier sir james goldsmith  is *interested in buying  the brewing interests_5  of  the leisure  ,  food  and drinks  giant  . 
$$
and  they  managed to eke out  that slim total return  only because of  interest_6 income  . 
$$
====================================== rising  interest_6 rates  also hammered  the most aggressive bond funds  , particularly  zero-coupon bond funds  . 
$$
 these funds  ,  which  invest in  bonds  sold at  a deep discount  and do n't pay  any interest_6  until  they  mature , are thus affected more than  other bond funds  by  fluctuations  in  *interest rates  . 
$$
======================================  mr. kern 's gloom  stems from  a string  of  recent economic indicators  showing that  britain 's inflationary pressure has n't  lost  potency  despite  15 months  of  rising interest_6 rates  . 
$$
======================================  economists  predict that because of  the inflationary signs  ,  interest_6 rates  will remain high , possibly hitting  15 %  , particularly if  sterling  continues to come under  pressure  . 
$$
but with  traders  expecting  west germany 's bundesbank  to push  short-term interest_6  rates  higher today  ,  the safe bet  was to be light on  dollars  . 
$$
 mr. spaulding  ,  50 years  old , succeeds  thomas ward  ,  51  ,  who  left to pursue  personal interests_3  . 
$$
consequently ,  corporations  such as  brand-name food  and  consumer-product companies   that  can generate  steady sales  to meet  interest_6 payments  are being valued more highly on  their buy-out potential  .

 that  is  one part  of  the loss  sustained by  taxpayers  , offset to  an extent   that  is not reported by  the interest_6  earned on  foreign-exchange holdings  . 
$$
======================================  the fed 's policy  of pushing up  interest_6 rates  from  march 1988  to  march 1989  , in  an attempt  to reduce  inflation  , pummeled  the housing industry  and eroded much of  the strength  in manufacturing .

 lin  has  a right  of  first refusal  to buy  metromedia 's interest_5  , and  some analysts  expect  lin  to exercise  that right  .

$$
 the fed  might have to raise  short-term interest_6 rates  for  a while  to yank down  the inflation rate  ,  he  concedes .

 the market  soared on  speculation  that  interest_6 rates  would continue to fall .

$$
shortly after  the government  announced  the figures  ,  chancellor  of  the exchequer nigel lawson  reiterated that  interest_6 rates  will remain `` at  whatever level  is necessary to keep on  top  of  inflation  .

but initially  the government  put  the second-quarter rate  at  1.7 %  , triggering  anxiety  that  the country  was heading for  a recession  and probably influencing  a federal reserve  move to let  interest_6 rates  fall in  late july  . 
$$
beginning in  march 1988  and continuing until  last spring  ,  the fed  steadily pushed up  interest_6 rates  to curb  economic activity  in  order  to restrain  inflation  . 
$$
 generale d'electricite  said  its group profit  after  payments  to  minority interests_5  nearly tripled in  the first   half  , partly as  a result  of accounting  changes  linked to  the creation  of  its joint venture  with  general electric co.  of  britain  . 
$$
====================================== to tell  your readers  `` to find out  which bonds  are safe and  which ones  risky , do n't look at  the ratings  ,  look  at  the interest_6 rate  '' is  unsound advice  . 
$$
 interest_6 rates  can fluctuate at  any time  for  many reasons  other than  a change  in  basic credit quality  .

======================================  short interest_5  is  the number  of  shares   that  have n't yet been purchased for  return  to  lenders  . 
$$
although  a substantial short position  reflects  heavy speculation  that  a stock 's price  will decline ,  some investors  consider  an increase  in  short interest_5  bullish because  the borrowed shares  eventually must be bought back .

======================================  the level  of  negative sentiment  measured by  the big board short interest_5 ratio  rose to  3.38  from  last month  's  3.13  .

$$
and  relative firmness  on  wall street  , along with  the lack  of  movement  by  west germany  on  interest_6 rates  , as feared  thursday  , helped to ease  fears  that  a major downward correction  was imminent .

$$
======================================  the delay  in getting  its lenders ' approval  of  the o&y loan  meant  campeau 's allied stores unit  missed  the interest_6 payment due friday  on  one series  of  junk bonds  . 
$$
 allied  said  it  paid  the interest_6  on  its 10 14 % senior notes due 1992  but did n't pay  the *interest  on  its 11 12 % senior subordinated debentures due 1997  .

$$
======================================  this week 's revision  of  the european currency unit  is n't likely to alter  interest_6 rates  on  ecu-denominated securities  . 
$$

$$
`` with  the inclusion  of  the peseta  and  escudo  ,  there  is apt to be  a rise  in  both   the short  - and  long-term interest_6 rates  since  the share  of  so-called soft-currency  or  high *interest countries  in  the currency basket  will increase , '' according to  a study  of  the ecu  by  ubs phillips  &  drew  . 
$$
====================================== according to  that study  , ``  the short-term ecu market interest_6 rate  after  the incorporation  of  the iberian currencies  will be about  85 basis points  above  the synthetical ecu reference *interest rate  , ''  which  does n't take  the peseta  and  escudo  into  consideration  . 
$$
====================================== as long as  foreign-exchange rates  between  the various european currencies  remain  stable  , then  fluctuations  in  interest_6 rates  on  ecu-denominated securities  should respond mainly to  the changing fortunes  of  yields  in  the constituent credit markets  , with  the greatest influence  exerted by  west germany  ,  france  ,  the u.k.  and  italy  .

$$
 many investors   who  wanted to sell could n't find  any buyers  , and  there  were  widespread fears  that  some junk-bond financed companies  , despite  the  relatively  strong economy  , were close to defaulting on  their heavy interest_6 payments  . 
$$
====================================== but  mr. milken  , seemingly siding with  his critics   who  have argued that  many companies ' stock prices  have been held down by  the burdensome interest_6 payments  called for by  their junk bonds  , argues that  a shift  away from  junk  is now  the best way  for  investors  to make  money  . 
$$
 integrated resources inc.  ,  a drexel client  , defaulted in  july  on nearly  $ 1 billion  in  debt  ;  resorts international inc.  failed to meet  interest_6 payments  on  $ 925 million  in  junk debt  .
